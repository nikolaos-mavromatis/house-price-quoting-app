## 💡 Tutorial vs How-To Guide

!!! info "What's the difference?"
    
    **Tutorials** are learning-oriented. They guide you through a complete journey to build understanding, even if you take detours that wouldn't be necessary in production.
    
    **[How-To Guides](../how-to/)** are problem-oriented. They provide direct solutions to specific tasks you want to accomplish.
    
    If you're new, start with tutorials. If you know what you want to do, jump to how-to guides.

## 🎯 Prerequisites

Most tutorials assume you have:

- [x] Python 3.12+ installed
- [x] Basic command line familiarity
- [x] Basic Python knowledge (variables, functions, imports)
- [x] (Optional) Docker installed for deployment tutorials

Don't worry if you're not an expert! The tutorials are designed for learners and provide complete, working examples.

## 🆘 Getting Help

If you get stuck while following a tutorial:

1. **Check the troubleshooting section** at the end of each tutorial
2. **Review the [Troubleshooting Guide](../how-to/troubleshooting.md)** for common issues
3. **Read the [Explanation](../explanation/)** section to understand concepts better
4. **Open an issue** on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikolaos-mavromatis/ames_house_price_prediction/issues) if you find a bug
